In this assignment, I was only able to complete the 1st & 3rd.

In the 1st question was unable to plot the 3D graph. Tried different ways & techniques but couldn't find the way.

In the 3rd question, I used different references to understand the inner workings of the neural network.
I was short on time, that is why couldn't achieve the required finesse. I tried implementing PyTree but it didn't work.

For BlackJax, I could find not very much information or documentation about it.
And also I don't have that much experience with JAX library, so faced some issues implementing it.
